## Test
Hello everyone! How's going? I wish that everyone is doing very well, today, I want to write about a thing, I've been wating for so long that
it making me old now. So what it would be? Let's guess, I presume this would be another blog talking about exotic plans that I've recently thought. What is more interesting about it is that this thing can go up to 100%%%%5 m,miles per hours and it'd be great if anyone want to contribute too.

## Codetest
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
This is a comment
*/
int main(void)
{
	    fprintf(stdout, "Hello world\n");
}
```

```apl
d←{⍵×10}
```

```py
from a import b
from typing_extension import Self

class Obj:
	def __init__(self: Self) -> None:
		pass
```
